# reaktoro-pse introduction
## 1. Overview
This is a package for configuring [Reaktoro](https://reaktoro.org/index.html) as a gray box model in [Pyomo](https://pyomo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), [IDAES-PSE](https://idaes-pse.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), and [WaterTAP](https://watertap.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) modeling libraries. This package is not meant to replace or act as a higher level API for Reaktoro - it is only meant to enable setting up Reaktoro equilibrium problems as blocks on Pyomo models and automate transferring Reaktoro data into Pyomo variables. 

## 2. Prerequisites
**The user must familiarize thyself with Reaktoro options and usage, especially when selecting Reaktoro provided databases, database files, and activity models for aqueous, solid, and gas phases. This package does not automatically select any of these options, and will use ideal models by default.**

* Please refer here for information on [Reaktoro supported databases](https://reaktoro.org/tutorials/basics/loading-databases.html) (all are supported) 
* Please refer here for information on [Reaktoro supported activity models](https://reaktoro.org/tutorials/basics/specifying-activity-models.html) (all are supported, included chain operations, or passing in pre-configured activity models)

**By default the package will use:**

* **Database:** [PhreeqcDatabase](https://reaktoro.org/api/classReaktoro_1_1PhreeqcDatabase.html) 
* **Data file:** [pitzer.dat](https://reaktoro.org/api/classReaktoro_1_1PhreeqcDatabase.html) 
* **Aqueous activity models:** [ActivityModelIdealAqueous](https://reaktoro.org/api/namespaceReaktoro.html#ae431d4c8a1f283910ae1cf35024091b8)
* **Gas activity models:** [ActivityModelIdealGas](https://reaktoro.org/api/namespaceReaktoro.html#a7a0788a5a863d987a88b81303d80b427)
* **Solid activity models:** [ActivityModelIdealSolution](https://reaktoro.org/api/namespaceReaktoro.html#a6581d5c0cde36cae6d9c46dbc32d56f8)
* **Ion exchange activity modells:** [ActivityModelIonExchange](https://reaktoro.org/api/namespaceReaktoro.html#a6581d5c0cde36cae6d9c46dbc32d56f8)

## 3. Inputs and outputs of the Reaktoro blocks
The Reaktoro blocks built by this package are designed to solve an equilibrium problem using user provided apparent species or true species, temperature, pressure, and pH, which are broken down to base elements and equilibrated within Reaktoro to provide exact speciation and equilibrium state. Using this state the block can return various information supported by Reaktoro:

* [Chemical properties](https://reaktoro.org/api/classReaktoro_1_1ChemicalProps.html)
* [Aqueous properties](https://reaktoro.org/api/classReaktoro_1_1AqueousProps.html)
* Pyomo build properties, which are custom properties built in Pyomo that use chemical properties or aqueous properties as inputs 

Note: Only Reaktoro properties that return a single floating point or real value are supported, as they will be directly matched to a [Pyomo Var](https://pyomo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/pyomo_modeling_components/Variables.html). Reaktoro functions that return arrays or strings are not supported.

## 5. Solvers 
To-date, this has only been tested with [cyipopt](https://cyipopt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) - other solvers have not been tested. 
* For accessing other [HSL linear solvers](http://www.hsl.rl.ac.uk/ipopt/) beyond MUMPS (such as MA27, MA57, etc. solver common to WaterTAP and IDAES-PSE) follow [these instructions](https://cyipopt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) for adding it to cyipopt.

## 6. Known issues

### Closing dual infeasibility 
In some cases Ipopt might struggle to close unscaled dual infeasibility even when primal is reduced to <1e-8. This will be typically seen in the solver trace, that shows **inf_pr** being reduced to <1e-8 and **inf_du** stops being reduced and solver does not terminate or terminates with **Solved to Acceptable level**. [This is a result of using approximated hessian in the GrayBox model causing issues in calculations of dual infeasibility error.](https://list.coin-or.org/pipermail/ipopt/2007-February/000700.html)

#### Solutions
A. Set Ipopt solver option "recalc_y" to "yes"

This option will force Ipopt to use least squares method to calculate dual infeasibility, potentially improving accuracy of its estimates and reduce it to below tolerance level. Details on the [recalc_y](https://coin-or.github.io/Ipopt/OPTIONS.html#OPT_recalc_y) and [recalc_y_feas_tol](https://coin-or.github.io/Ipopt/OPTIONS.html#OPT_recalc_y_feas_tol). 

    cy_solver = get_solver(solver="cyipopt-watertap")
    cy_solver.options['recalc_y']='yes'
    cy_solver.options["recalc_y_feas_tol"] = 1e-2


B. Use exact derivatives instead of numeric

The numeric derivatives carry additional errors that reduce accuracy in estimates of dual infeasibility. You can check which outputs in your Reaktoro block are exact or numeric by using **your_reaktor_block.display_jacobian_outputs()**. 

If option "A" did not work, using exact derivatives can potentially solve this issue. This can be accomplished by using properties with exact derivatives listed in [JacoibanRows class](https://github.com/watertap-org/reaktoro-pse/blob/868efe883dbc26654b53a32e5a58e8b6ee2af5c7/src/reaktoro_pse/core/reaktoro_jacobian.py#L51). These properties can be used to write Pyomo constraints that calculate the desired property. Some properties are already supported and examples are shown of how to build them in [PyomoProperties](https://github.com/watertap-org/reaktoro-pse/blob/868efe883dbc26654b53a32e5a58e8b6ee2af5c7/src/reaktoro_pse/core/reaktoro_outputs.py#L118) class. 

Supported PyomoProperties with exact derivatives:

- scalingTendencyDirect - this only designed to work with PhreeqC data bases 
- phDirect
- osmoticPressure
- vaporPressure

These properties are accessed as any other property in ReaktoroBlock. Simply pass ('scalingTendencyDirect',phase) to outputs.  

### Failing due to iterates diverging
In some cases you might experience a failed solve with error

    EXIT: Iterates diverging; problem might be unbounded.
    
This, in general, is a result of bad scaling. If your model solves with out a ReaktoroBlock, then the likely culprit is autoscaling for Jacobian (and possibly variables as well). In this case its recommend to provide manual scaling for the jacobian via user scaling option when building Reaktoro, for example as follows (check thermal_precipitation.py example): 

    jacobian_options={
        "user_scaling": {
            ("molarEnthalpy", None): 1,
            ("specificHeatCapacityConstP", None): 1,
        },
    }

You can check the jacobian scaling by calling: 

    your_reaktoro_block.display_jacobian_scaling()

An alternative is to increase the divergence tolerance: 

    solver.options["diverging_iterates_tol"] = 1e30
